### Results
- The most common ages among our customers are 31, 32, and 34 years old. Majority of the customers work in management, blue-collar jobs, or as technicians. Most of the customers are married, followed by those who are single or divorced. In terms of education, most of the customers have completed secondary education, followed by tertiary and primary education. These insights help us better understand our target audience.
- In the analysis of loan defaults among the customers, it was observed that a vast majority, precisely 98.49%, successfully met their loan obligations without any defaults. Conversely, a small fraction of customers, amounting to 1.51%, experienced defaults on their loans. This offers valuable insight into the risk factors associated with loan defaults among our customers.
- Customers aged 27, 45, and 44 are the most common age groups to default on loans. This aids in identifying potential risk factors in every demographic.
- The analysis of customer account balances shows a mean balance of $1528.54, with a standard deviation of $3225.41, indicating significant variability. The balances range from a minimum of -$6847.00 to a maximum of $81204.00. The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles are $122.00, $550.00, and $1708.00, respectively. This data is crucial in identifying high-value customer segments and tailoring effective marketing strategies.
- The assessment of customer engagement via different contact methods reveals that the cellular method is the most effective, with 8042 engagements. The method labeled as "unknown" resulted in 2346 engagements, while the telephone method yielded 774 engagements. This data is instrumental in understanding and optimizing customer outreach strategies.
- The conversion rates for the different contact methods are as follows: The cellular method has a conversion rate of 54.33% and a non-conversion rate of 45.67%. The telephone method shows a nearly equal distribution with a conversion rate of 50.39% and a non-conversion rate of 49.61%. The method labeled as ‘unknown’ has a significantly lower conversion rate of 22.59%, with a non-conversion rate of 77.41%.
- The average duration of contact and number of interactions vary based on marital status. Divorced customers have the longest average contact duration of 392.48 units and an average of 2.46 interactions. Married customers have a slightly shorter average contact duration of 361.06 units, but a higher average of 2.62 interactions. Single customers have an average contact duration of 384.20 units and the fewest interactions, averaging at 2.32.
